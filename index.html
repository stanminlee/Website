                    At the Bhamla Lab, I researched frugal experimental hardware under Dr. Saad Bhamla, assistant professor in the School of
                    Biomolecular and Chemical Engineering at the Georgia Institute of Technology. Alongside three other interns, we developed the early 
                    prototyping for a frugal bacterial freeze-dryer (lyophilizer).

                    Typically, these machines cost tens of thousands of dollars and are challenging to transport due to their large size and weight. 
                    The freeze-drying process allows bacteria to be preserved for long-term storage without the need for continuous refrigeration. 
                    This technology has various applications in fields such as vaccine delivery, food production, and biotechnology.

                    However, in underresourced areas where access to expensive laboratory equipment is limited, developing a frugal bacterial freeze-dryer becomes crucial. 
                    The aim was to create a cost-effective and portable alternative that can be easily transported and deployed in resource-constrained settings.
                    We explored and tested innovative approaches to optimize the freeze-drying process, considering factors such as energy efficiency, scalability, and ease of use.

                    We were able to successfully implement our prototype to bacterial biosensors detecting nutrient levels in small-scale hydroponic
                    agriculture, and we were able to extend the shelf-life for up to one week without refrigeration. Taking these findings to the
                    2021 International Genetically Engineered Machine (iGEM) competition yielded a "Best Hardware" award nomination and helped our
                    school recieve a gold medal and place top ten in the world.

                    In the introductory probability class for computing (CS 109), we were tasked with implementing a Naïve Bayes machine learning
                    algorithm for binary input data. I used the NumPy and Pandas external libraries and material learned throughout the class.

                <br><br>
                <b_text>
                    The algorithm is able to predict Netflix preferences (from their other preferences), Ancestry location (from DNA), and Heart Disease (from scanning results)
                    with about 80% accuracy.

                <b_text>
                    One of the key learnings from this project was understanding how probabilistic 
                    algorithms like Naïve Bayes work under the hood and apply in real-world scenarios.
                    I learned how to leverage Python external libraries to perform mathematical calculations and create
                    a basic machine learning algorithm.

                    I created a budgeting web application, where users can input their monthly income and add certain expenses. EasyBudget displays
                    additional information and suggestions based on your income and the 50/30/20 rule. I utilized Python, Bootstrap, HTML/CSS, and
                    Javascript to create the user interface, and I am currently working on better expense visualization, such as a graph.

                <b_text>
                     EasyBudget is not just a user interface; it also stores your data. I used Flask and SQL for a functional backend, where all of your income
                     and expense data is stored. You need to register with a valid e-mail address and password. I am working to store data from past months, so
                     users can see their overall savings and progress.

                    Drawing from my experiences, past projects, development of my personal website, I was able to create an application that
                    people can use for everyday life. I learned how to integrate a user interface with a functional backend and database.
